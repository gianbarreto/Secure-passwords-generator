# Secure Passwords Generator

## Objective  
The **Secure Passwords Generator** project was developed to create strong, randomly generated passwords that enhance security for online accounts, applications, and sensitive data storage. This project aims to help users generate passwords that follow best security practices, reducing the risk of brute-force and dictionary attacks.

## Skills Learned  
- Understanding of cryptographic randomness and password entropy.  
- Implementation of secure password policies (length, complexity, character sets).  
- Proficiency in Python for security-related applications.  
- Handling user input and implementing CLI/GUI interactions.  
- Strengthening cybersecurity awareness in authentication mechanisms.  

## Tools Used  
- **Python** – Core language.
- **Random & Secrets Libraries** – Used for secure random password generation.
